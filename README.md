# Emission Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing emission data to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to environmental impact. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we explore emissions across different regions and time periods.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series analysis of emissions
- Geospatial visualization of emission sources
- Interactive charts and dashboards

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly for interactive visualizations

## Dataset
The analysis is based on emissions-related data from various sources. The dataset includes information on emission levels across different regions, and timeframes

## Results & Insights
- Top 10 emission producing countries across time
- Egyptian Emission trends for the last 10 year

## Future Improvements
- Integration of real-time emission data
- Machine learning models for predictive analysis
